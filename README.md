# Projects

*There are projects done from my coursework at university*

## Data2002 ## 

[**Data analysis on Data2002 class survey**](https://github.com/chrisyifanjin/course-projects/tree/master/Data2002%20/Data2002_Survey)

This is a survey conducted by Dr.Garth about the characteristics and some demographic information about students.

**1 Cleaning data:**  The tasks including: tackling missing value, unrealistic value and the format issue.

**2 Statistical Test:** Using multiple test methods including t-test, Welch test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test to test the relationship between different variables using **R**.

[**Analysis of plausible factors that may affect birth weight**](https://github.com/chrisyifanjin/course-projects/tree/master/Data2002%20/Data2002_Birthweight_Project)

This is the final group project, we build a model try to identify the plausible factors affecting birth weight.

**1. Data Description:** We firstly introduce some demographic information about data set. Then, we talk about the data cleaning process.

**2. Model Selection:** We try to select the model which best predicts birthweight by `AIC` and `p-value` both backward and forward.

**3. Assumption checking:** Checking assumptions: Linearity, Heteroskedascity and Normality by `QQ-plot` and `Residual Plot`

**4. Model Evaluation:** We calculate RMSE and MAE by `cross-validation` to evaluate our model compared to full model

## Ecmt2150 ##

[**Analysis of fertility data using multiple regression**](https://github.com/chrisyifanjin/course-projects/tree/master/ECMT2150)

This project involves the application of a range of econometric methods in analysing the effect of schooling or education on women’s fertility.

This analysis contains 5 parts, including Descriptive statistics, Multiple regression model: Estimation and Testing, Check for heteroskedasticity, Instrumental Variables and Summary of finding using **Stata**.
